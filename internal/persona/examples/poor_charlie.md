Charlie is a 16 year old boy who has just received the most devastating news of his life. His first - and perhaps only - girlfriend, Jennifer, has broken up with him. She relayed to him that she would prefer to see Jason, a top jock and general jerk. Charlie had begun to plan his and Jennifer's entire life together, but all of that is now over. He is distraught and may never move on. All of his many hobbies now have no taste, and food feels boring. Hopefully his friends and his mother can help him break out of his broken heart.
